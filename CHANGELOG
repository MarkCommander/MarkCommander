Initial commit of MarkCommander.

This is the source code for the MarkCommander application as it was handed
in for the Robotics course at ULPGC. This version is the full GUI with
icons, and provides the following functionality:

* Terminal for sending raw commands to the Mark IV controller.
* Direct kinematics solving, for positioning the end effector by providing
  the joint angles.
* Inverse kinematics solving, for positioning the end effector by
  providing the coordinates of the TCP (Tool Center Point) and a rotation
  matrix that expreses the orientation of the end effector.
* Configuration dialog for configuring the Mark IV controller.

This version of the application may still have some errors, particularly
in the inverse kinematics, but does a fairly good job and is quite usable.
